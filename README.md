# Stochastic Methods for Finance

This project focused on the study and implementation of **stochastic models in finance**, with particular emphasis on **stochastic differential equations (SDEs)** and their applications to derivative pricing and interest rate modeling.  


## Methodology
- Formulation of financial models based on **stochastic calculus**.  
- Numerical implementation using **Monte Carlo simulations** and discretization schemes (e.g., Euler–Maruyama).  
- Comparative analysis with analytical solutions where available (e.g., Black–Scholes model).  
- Exploration of extensions to more advanced models as presented in **Hall** and **Björk**.  


## Results
- Simulation of asset price dynamics under stochastic processes.  
- Pricing of European options via Monte Carlo estimation and comparison with closed-form solutions.  
- Preliminary exploration of interest rate models and their numerical behavior.
